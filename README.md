## (2)Write a C program to read 3 characters one by one and print the characters in a reverse order.
## AIM:
To write a C program to read 3 characters one by one and print the characters in a reverse order.
## ALGORITHM:

2. Use the scanf function to read the characters one by one from the user.
3. Print the characters in reverse order using the printf function.
4. End the program.
## PROGRAM:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char a,b,c;
    scanf("%c %c %c",&a,&b,&c);
    printf("The reverse of %c%c%c is %c%c%c",a,b,c,c,b,a);
}
```
